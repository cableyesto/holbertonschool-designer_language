# Designer language

## Put yourself in a Designer’s shoes
### Learning objectives

Understand how designers work by:

- solving a UX problem;
- writing a UX case study that explains your discoveries.

Be creative. You will not be evaluated on the success or feasibility of the final solution, but on how you have solved the initial problem, by writing a design case study that communicates each step of the process and what you have learned/discovered.

- Here is a template to help you with the structure
- To achieve this, you will follow the tasks below. Along the way, you will gather pieces of content that should give you enough substance to write your story.
- Make sure to include any photo of your notes, sketches (paper or whiteboard) and paper prototypes! You are also encouraged to include the materials provided by the research team in your case study.

## One project, 3 parts

This project is split in 3 parts:

- <b>Research:</b> where you will get familiar with these 3 personas, UX problems and starting to think about solutions
- <b>Prototype:</b> this one, put in Figma your thinking prototypes
- <b>Validate:</b> share your work with other users/students and get feedback on it

The final result will be a blog post, posted in LinkedIn and/or Medium, that you will add more contents during each part.

## Tasks

After reviewing the business’ goals at the end of last quarter, the Research team wants to identify if we have an opportunity to make users’ stream more content. They have identified a challenge which they think is worth exploring: “Improve how Spotify users find music to listen to.”

With this in mind, the UX Research team gathered data and conducted user interviews. Here are a few personas that illustrate different chunks of the user base for this challenge:

Alex, student, wants to find better focus while he studies.\
Michelle, nurse practitioner, wants to discover new genre.\
Regina, retired, wants to build a library of saved songs based on her tastes. 

These fictional characters are here to help to keep your focus on solving ONE problem.

This exercise focuses on the Spotify desktop app experience. If you don’t have it yet, you can download it for free here: www.spotify.com/download — note that the download will start automatically by clicking this link.
