## Quick Recap

When following the Design Thinking methodology, the research phase previously done is the equivalent of the 3rd phase of Design Thinking which is called Ideate.\
The scope of this UX problem is to improve how Spotify users find music to listen to.\
Based on the materials provided such as persona and user journey map by some fictional UX researcher.

The purpose of the previous task was to empersonate a fictionnal characters called Alex.\
Alex is an undergraduate student, he his trying to find better focus while he studies.

The choosen idea to solve Alex's problem is to improve the search bar, by adding auto-completion inside the search filters, categories  


## The Prototype phase
Following the Design Thinking methodology, this is the 4th step is called Prototype.

We created a storyboard of the user flow, and then generate some prototype using Figma.


### Storyboard of the user flow
![alt text](https://github.com/cableyesto/holbertonschool-designer_language/blob/master/prototype/img/StoryBoard.png?raw=true)

To sum up the user flow. Alex wants to easily add some new playlist to focus while working.
The user starts using the application with the Homepage screen, the search bar does appear once
the user clicked on the Browse Tab on the left menu.

He moves to the Browse Screen a search bar does appear.
He can use some fiters to have a more accurate search query. He can also choose between Playlists, Songs, Music, so that the results will only match the picked option.

The user interaction is as follow:\
1- Insert some text in the search bar.\
2- Toggle the type of music researched.\
3- Add filters to precise the query.\
4- Click on the loop icon.

The Playlist screen will all music that contains a playlist. There is a button to add the playlist to the user's playlist.

The Playlists Result screen is displaying all the playlists that matches the word provided in the search bar. The possible interaction in this page is to either click on a playlist to check it's music. Or directly press on the add icon to directly the playlist to the user's playlists.

The Playlist Added Screen will display to the user a popup that notify the user that the playlist was added. 

### Interactive prototype

here</a> the interactive prototype on Figma.

## Next phase
The final phase of the Design Thinking methodology that comes right after the prototype is named Test.
It's purpose is to evaluate if your users successfully interact with your interactive prototype or with a final solution.
