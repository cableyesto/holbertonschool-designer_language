## 0. Prototype: make your solution real enough

In order to validate your solution, you need to produce a prototype that looks like the real product.

- First, you will need to first storyboard your solution.
    - Sketch the user flow on a whiteboard or on paper
    - Take a photo
- Then, design the high-fidelity mockups in Figma
    - If you are not familiar with Figma, take a quick tour of the interface.
- And finally, pull them together to make your prototype interactive (clickable)
    - Learn about prototyping with Figma

Things you should have collected:

- Storyboard of user flow (photo of whiteboard or sketches)\
- The link to view your “pixel-perfect” mockups\
- The link to access the interactive prototype on Figma

Please submit a link to a blog post (on Medium or by using a Google Doc, if you don’t want to make it public). In the blog post you should include the images of your mockups as well as your Figma design. Talk the audience through your design process and where you finally landed in your design!

To not start from scratch, you can reuse the initial Spotify file that Juno - C#8 made - duplicate it and enjoy!
